# Quiz App

This project is a Django-based quiz application. It uses SQLite for the questions database, HTML for the webpages, and Bootstrap 5 for styling.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Backend framework
- **SQLite**: Database for storing questions
- **HTML**: Markup language for webpages
- **Bootstrap 5**: CSS framework for styling
- **ApexCharts.js**: ðŸ“Š Interactive JavaScript Charts built on SVG 

## Current Functionality

Very basic quiz, with only 10 questions and an end screen which displays score.

## To-do
- Prevent manually refreshing from changing question
    - could be done by preventing a question from being checked as "completed" only when answered
- Add more questions and integrate the scoring into a separate window/on screen elsewhere
- Beautify UI more (particularly buttons)
- Add unit testing and proper logging
- Add proper comments
