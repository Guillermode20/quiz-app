# Quiz App

This project is a Django-based quiz application. It uses SQLite for the questions database, HTML for the webpages, and Bootstrap 5 for styling.

This is a fork of my original project that replaces the local database with fetching trivia questions from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/). 

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Backend framework
- **SQLite**: Database for storing questions
- **HTML**: Markup language for webpages
- **Bootstrap 5**: CSS framework for styling
- **ApexCharts.js**: ðŸ“Š Interactive JavaScript Charts built on SVG 

## Current Functionality

Very basic quiz, with only 10 questions and an end screen which displays score.

## To-do
- Prevent manually refreshing from changing question
    - could be done by preventing a question from being checked as "completed" only when answered
- Add more questions and integrate the scoring into a separate window/on screen elsewhere
- Beautify UI more (particularly buttons)
- Add unit testing and proper logging
- Add proper comments

## Installation

    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
3. Load your questions, a placeholder question set is provided in the form of ```questions.json```:
    ```python manage.py load_questions
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
4. Run the development server:
    ```bash

    ```

## Usage

Optional (but recommended):
1. Create an admin profile with ```python manage.py createsuperuser```
